# Mode-1-Project

Project Contributors: Mohamad Eldebek and Omer Hakim

Goals:
The goals of our project were to find data about movies that can give investors new ideas regarding possible investments.

Method of Work:
The first phase was cultivating data from “The Movie Data Base”. We use API key to get the data, and we sorted out information regarding votes count and vote averages and looking for correlation between the two.
The second phase was scraping data from Wikipedia about the nominees for the academy award for the best foreign pictures (from 1956 onward), and based od this data looking for interesting opportunities to investment abroad.
